= Is it possible to define your own colors? =

At present there is no interface, however you can override the CSS file yourself. First backup the existing on in css/style.css and then modify it. Note that your changes might be overwritten by an update, so you might want to keep them in another plugin, or include them (or override them) via your theme's functions.php file.
